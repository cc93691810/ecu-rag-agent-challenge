1,Single Source - ECU-700,"What is the maximum operating temperature for the ECU-750?","The maximum operating temperature for the ECU-750 is +85°C. The ECU-750 operates in a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C.","Accuracy of temperature specification; Source identification (ECU-700 manual)"
2,Single Source - ECU-800,"How much RAM does the ECU-850 have?","The ECU-850 has 2 GB of LPDDR4 RAM.","Correct memory specification; Source identification (ECU-800 base specs)"
3,Single Source - ECU-800 Enhanced,"What are the AI capabilities of the ECU-850b?","The ECU-850b features a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of 5 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) for AI acceleration. This makes it suitable for edge AI workloads.","NPU specification accuracy; Understanding of AI capabilities"
4,Comparative - Same Series,"What are the differences between ECU-850 and ECU-850b?","The ECU-850b is an enhanced variant of the ECU-850 with three key upgrades: Dedicated AI Accelerator (NPU capable of 5 TOPS), Increased Memory (4 GB LPDDR4 RAM vs 2 GB), Higher Clock Speed (Cortex-A53 cores at 1.5 GHz vs 1.2 GHz).","Accurate comparison; Synthesis of multiple specifications; Clear differentiation"
5,Comparative - Cross Series,"Compare the CAN bus capabilities of ECU-750 and ECU-850.","The ECU-750 (700 series) has a single channel CAN FD interface with speeds up to 1 Mbps, while the ECU-850 (800 series) features a dual channel CAN FD interface with speeds up to 2 Mbps per channel. The ECU-850 offers significantly better CAN bus performance and redundancy.","Cross-document retrieval; Accurate technical comparison; Performance analysis"
6,Technical Specification,"What is the power consumption of the ECU-850b under load?","The ECU-850b consumes 1.7A under load and 550mA when idle.","Accurate power specification; Distinction between load and idle states"
7,Feature Availability,"Which ECU models support Over-the-Air (OTA) updates?","OTA updates are supported by the ECU-800 Series (ECU-850 and ECU-850b). The ECU-700 Series (ECU-750) does not support OTA updates, as explicitly stated in its documentation.","Feature availability across series; Negative confirmation for unsupported models"
8,Storage Comparison,"How does the storage capacity compare across all ECU models?","Storage capacity varies significantly across the series: ECU-750 (700 series): 2 MB Internal Flash; ECU-850 (800 series): 16 GB eMMC; ECU-850b (800 series): 32 GB eMMC. The 800 series offers substantially more storage than the legacy 700 series.","Complete storage comparison; Understanding of capacity differences; Series analysis"
9,Operating Environment,"Which ECU can operate in the harshest temperature conditions?","The ECU-850 and ECU-850b (800 series) can operate in the harshest temperature conditions, with an operating range of -40°C to +105°C. The ECU-750 (700 series) has a more limited range of -40°C to +85°C, making it 20°C less tolerant at the high end.","Temperature range comparison; Identification of best performing model; Quantitative analysis"
10,Configuration/Usage,"How do you enable the NPU on the ECU-850b?","To enable the NPU on the ECU-850b, use the following driver command: me-driver-ctl --enable-npu --mode=performance","Exact command syntax; Configuration procedure knowledge"
